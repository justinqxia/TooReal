# TooReal
<i>You've heard of BeReal. Get ready for TooReal.</i> <br>
Instead of sending a notification at a random point in the day, TooReal will, at some random point throughout the day,
take a screenshot of your computer screen and post it on the site. There is no warning, no upside, but a lot of fun.

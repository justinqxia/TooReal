# TooReal
<i>You've heard of BeReal. Get ready for TooReal.</i> <br>
### Intro
We've all heard of BeReal. At some random point throughout the day, BeReal will send you a notification, and you have
two minutes to take a photo using <b>both</b> the front and rear cameras. Then, the photo will be posted for all your
friends to see. Additionally, you must post a photo before you can see everyone else's photo. </br>
Despite BeReal's goal of being a social media platform where people can be authentic, the ability to ignore the notification
and just post late means that people oftentimes wait until they are doing something exciting to take their BeReal, thus 
defeating the whole point of being an "authentic" social media platform. <br>
### The Solution
To resolve this issue, we created TooReal, the next sensation in social media. Instead of sending a notification 
at some random point throughout the day, TooReal will, at complete random and without warning, take a screenshot of your 
computer screen and post it on the site. The next step in authenticity, TooReal takes user input out of the equation,
allowing for others to see a truly random point in your daily life. We also wanted to challenge the idea of "friends". Why
should you be able to select who sees the photos you post? When creating TooReal, we decided that <b>everyone</b> should be
able to see each other's posts, regardless of whether they know that person or not. <br>

### How to Use
To use TooReal, simply download screenshot.py, and run the file. You may have to ensure you have python and the appropriate 
imports. The script will run automatically for you, leaving you free to go about your daily life while simultaneously sharing 
it with the world.
